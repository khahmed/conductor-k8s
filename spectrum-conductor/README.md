# Spectrum Conductor with Spark

IBMÂ® Spectrum Conductor with Spark is an end-to-end enterprise solution for Apache Spark, maximizing resource usage of multiple Apache Spark deployments. It enhances performance and scale by eliminating resource silos that are tied to separate Apache Spark implementations. It also provides high-performance cluster management capabilities to efficiently manage and keep your Apache Spark clusters running reliably throughout their lifecycle.

The chart installs a Conductor master and worker node according to the following
pattern:

- A `Deployment` is used to create a Replica Set of Conductor master and worker pods.
  ([templates/deployment.yaml](templates/deployment.yaml))
- A `Service` is used to create a gateway to the pods running in the
  replica set ([templates/service.yaml](templates/svc.yaml)) so that end user
  access to Conductor dashboard.

The [values.yaml](values.yaml) exposes a few of the configuration options in the
charts, though there are some that are not exposed there.

Quick Start
-----------

0. Build Conductor Image

The chart assumes that the Conductor image is built and is available in a Docker registry. See https://github.com/khahmed/conductor-k8s

1. Create a Persistent Volume


The Conductor chart requires access to storage in order to persist the cluster state, which is performed through the Kubernetes Volume Claim mechanism. The storage can be allocated in the private cloud admin console.

~~~
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
   name: vol01
spec:
   capacity:
      storage: 10Gi
   accessModes:
      - ReadWriteMany
   persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
   nfs:
      path: /var/nfs/share1
      server: 9.21.58.21

~~~

2.  Label Nodes for Running Conductor components

Nodes must be labeled as targets for Conductor deployment. The current chart uses hostNetwork so that only one Conductor container per node. Conductor can use all the resources on a node to run analytics workloads. 

~~~
kubectl label --overwrite  node 9.21.58.21  deploy_cws_master="true"
kubectl label --overwrite  node 9.21.58.33  deploy_cws_master="false"
~~~

3. Install the chart

You can use the  ICp App Center to deploy a Conductor cluster including master and workers using the deployment wizard
to enter the values. Alternatively use the helm CLI:

~~~
helm repo add conductor https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khahmed/conductor-k8s/master/
helm install --name conductor  --set cluster.master=master-node --set cluster.pvc=conductor --set cluster.image.repository=master.cfc:8500/default/spectrum-conductor --set cluster.image.tag=7.2 --set license.key1="license key 1" --set license.key2="license key 2" conductor/spectrum-conductor
~~~

NOTE: You need to obtain a license for Conductor 

The following parameters can be modified with the --set option

4. Verify Conductor Pods are running

After installation the Conductor pods should be running:

~~~
khalids-mbp:spectrum-conductor khalida$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default-spectrum-conductor-1885277081-r1dvc         1/1       Running   0          19h
default-spectrum-conductor-slave-2401316592-dmdvd   1/1       Running   0          19h
~~~

5. Access the Conductor Management UI

You can go the ICp console and access the Conductor Admin console from the Application details
